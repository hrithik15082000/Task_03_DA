# 📊 Retail Orders Database – Querying Fundamentals

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on learning and applying **basic SQL operations** using a retail dataset (`Walmart_Sales.csv`). The goal is to strengthen SQL fundamentals by performing querying, filtering, aggregation, and visualization. The dataset contains store-level weekly sales along with additional factors such as temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Practice **SQL basics** – SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, LIMIT, AS  
- Explore **aggregate functions** such as SUM, COUNT, and AVG  
- Work with **date functions** (MONTH extraction using `strftime`)  
- Apply **conditional logic** using CASE WHEN  
- Visualize SQL query results in Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn)  
- Compare **Holiday vs Non-Holiday** sales  
- Perform extended queries like DISTINCT, BETWEEN, IN, HAVING  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**  
- **SQLite (via `sqlite3` in Python)**  
- **Pandas** for SQL integration and DataFrame handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description (`Walmart_Sales.csv`)  
- **Store** → Store ID (1–45)  
- **Date** → Week date  
- **Weekly_Sales** → Sales revenue for that week  
- **Holiday_Flag** → 1 if holiday week, 0 otherwise  
- **Temperature** → Average temperature of the week  
- **Fuel_Price** → Fuel cost during that week  
- **CPI** → Consumer Price Index  
- **Unemployment** → Unemployment rate  

Total Records: **6435**

## 🔑 Steps Performed  

1. **Loaded dataset** into Pandas and created SQLite table `orders`.  
2. **Basic SQL Queries**  
   - SELECT specific columns  
   - WHERE conditions for filtering  
   - ORDER BY for sorting  
   - GROUP BY with SUM, AVG  
   - LIMIT & ALIAS usage  
   - Date functions with `strftime` for monthly trends  
3. **Extended Queries**  
   - DISTINCT values (unique stores)  
   - BETWEEN for range filtering  
   - IN for multiple store selection  
   - HAVING with aggregated filters  
   - CASE WHEN for Holiday vs Normal day sales  
4. **Visualizations**  
   - Monthly Sales Trend (line plot)  
   - Top 10 Stores by Sales (bar chart)  
   - Holiday vs Non-Holiday Sales (bar chart)  
5. **Session Closure** → Exported cleaned/aggregated results and closed SQL connection.  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Sales trends vary significantly across months (seasonality detected).  
- Some stores consistently outperform others with much higher sales.  
- Holiday weeks contribute disproportionately to overall sales.  
- External factors like unemployment and CPI can be linked with performance.

## ✅ Conclusion  
This project successfully demonstrates SQL fundamentals using a real-world retail dataset. It not only covers querying operations but also bridges SQL with Python-based visualization, enhancing practical data analysis and business intelligence skills.
